# Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python

This repository contains my solutions and implementations of exercises from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor.

## About The Book

"An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (ISLP) provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, which is an essential toolkit for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/islp-python.git
   cd islp-python
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each chapter folder contains two main subfolders:

- **labs/**: Implementations of the code examples from the book
- **exercises/**: My solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises

To run any notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to the desired notebook file.

## Data

The `data/` directory contains datasets used in the book or referenced in the exercises. Some larger datasets may need to be downloaded separately following instructions in the relevant notebooks.
